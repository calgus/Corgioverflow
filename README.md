Corgioverflow
=========

Usage
=====

Composer
--------
Corgioverflow git should come with the vendor map that contains all needed 
composer packages. If doing manually, add
```
    "require": {
        "php": ">=5.4",
        "phpmvc/comment": "dev-master",
        "mos/cform": "2.*@dev",
        "mos/cdatabase": "dev-master"
    }
```
to your `composer.json` file, use Packagist/Composer and update, and then manually 
edit `vendor/mos/cform/src/HTMLForm/CForm.php` with:
```PHP
    /**
     * Get values of a form elements checked boxes.
     *
     * @param string $element the name of the formelement.
     *
     * @return mixed the value of the element.
     */
    public function values($element)
    {
        return $this[$element]['checked'];
    }
```
preferably at row 167 for easy finding. This edit will allow you to get marked values 
from a multiple checkbox form. This is only required when manually using composer packages.

SQL
---
Import SQL tables from `sql/sqlimport.sql` to your SQL host using the import feature.
This will create tables used by Corgioverflow and a set of tags used when creating 
questions. Adding/removing in table `corgi_commentcategory` will allow you to make new tags.

Edit `app/config/config_mysqlonline.php` and change:
```PHP
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'YOUR PASSWORD');
'dsn'     => "mysql:host=HOSTNAME;dbname=DATABASENAME;"
'username'        => "YOUR USERNAME"
```
to your specific details. 

For local use edit `app/config/config_mysql.php` and change:
```PHP
'dsn'     => "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=DATABASENAME;"
```
to your preferred database.

Setting up your webpage
-----------------------
Edit `webroot/.htaccess` and remove commented RewriteEngine for online use if needed.

---
To change between online/offline use edit `webroot/index.php` and change:
```PHP
    $db->setOptions(require ANAX_APP_PATH . 'config/config_mysqlonline.php');
```
to `$db->setOptions(require ANAX_APP_PATH . 'config/config_mysql.php');`

---
Change permissions for folder `webroot/css/anax-grid` to 777 which allows less files 
to be created. If CSS is not loaded when viewing page delete `webroot/css/anax-grid/style.css`
and `webroot/css/anax-grid/style.less.cache` so new ones will be created.
